# MNIST-Classifier
This program was to help tech myself the basics of tensorflow and AI in general, I did use a tutorial to make sure I was doing 
everything correctly

If you want to run this code, download Anaconda and use Spyder to run this, Anaconda should come with tensorflow pre-installed along with a bunch of other useful libraries for python, but if you get an error saying that tensorflow isn't installed, you can do that thorugh the GUI interface in anaconda.

Just a quick overview of what the code does:
The MNIST dataset is about 60000 images that are 28x28 pixels, and they all contain handwritten numbers, the goal of this AI is to be
able to recognize and categorize each number based on what it thinks it is (at the end of training if you run it, it will tell you the
accuracy of it). With the current parameters that I have in the AI, it gets about 90% accuracy each time you run it. Fell free to download
this and experiment with the parameters and see if you can do better!
