# MNIST-Classifier
This program was to help tech myself the basics of tensorflow and AI in general, I did use a tutorial to make sure I was doing 
everything correctly

If you want to run this code, download Anaconda and use Spyder to run this, Anaconda comes with tensorflow pre-installed along with a bunch 
of other useful libraries for python.
